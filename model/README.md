Three CNN object segmentation models with varying learning rate and beta parameters are used to create individual submissions. Non-max supression is then carried out on the individual submissions to create a final submission file. Run notebooks in following order to reproduce results:

1. CNN-Segmentation notebooks (run all three)
2. nms_preds_cnns_t0.6 ipynb
